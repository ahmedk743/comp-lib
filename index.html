        <h2 class="subtitle">PROBLEM:</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          When coding with languages/frameworks/libraries especially with
          principle idea of reusability one might always come across the problem
          of reusing same components again and again, more specifically when
          working out with Reactjs or React Native. Someone writes a module
          (here we are addressing React Component) which can be used later in
          multiple projects, a simple web app can solve this problem by creating
          one's own simple personalized library. So problem lies with
          synchronization of those codebases across cloud. As this could be
          acheived by platforms like GitHub but they are not specifically
          designed for React.

          <h2 class="subtitle">NOTABLE FEATURES:</h2>
          <h4>1. Simple UI:</h4>
          <p class="paragraph">
            The problem with GitHub or remote repositories like that is they use
            it with Git Version control system, as it is a lengthy process to
            save your code snippets. So there should be a simple web app which
            can be accessed from anywhere and it should be as simple as possible
            to copy/paste code over there.

        <div class="feature">
          <h4>2. Account:</h4>
          <p class="paragraph">
            Every User would create his/her own personal library using his
            account.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature">
          <h4>3. Peerly Dependant Components:</h4>
          <p class="paragraph">
            One of the biggest feature we are gonna acheive through this app is
            to handle components which are dependent on each other. This usually
            happens when one component is using another module or component and
            they are present in different.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature">
          <h4>4. Future:</h4>
          <p class="paragraph">
            In future this project can be extended into a VSCode Extension which
            would make it more easy for users to interact with their own code
            snippets and use them within Visual Studio Code.
